# Erlang NIF bindings for Houdini Engine.
# WORK IN PROGRESS

## Goals of this project.

* To be able to run [Houdini Engine](http://www.sidefx.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=blogcategory&id=227&Itemid=381) instance (and be able to perform asset instantiation, cooking, etc.) on an [Erlang](http://www.erlang.org/) (as well as [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org)) node.
* Create an HTTP RESTful service based on this NIF.
* Create a WebGL client to interact with the RESTful service.

## Status.
- [x] Generation of HAPI enum c translation stubs.
- [ ] Generation of Erlang enum mappings. Not required?
- [x] Generation of HAPI struct c translation stubs.
- [x] Generation of Erlang records corresponding to HAPI structs.
- [x] Generation of HAPI function c stubs.
- [x] Generation of Erlang function stubs.
- [x] Generation of NIF Export c table.
- [ ] Adding tests - Work in progress.
- [x] Working Mac OS X port.
- [ ] Working Linux port.
- [ ] Working Windows port.
- [ ] Adding full Elixir / Mix support.

## Before building, required steps.
* Will build only on Mac OS X right now.
  * If you want to build on another platform you will need to patch rebar.config .
  * Stubs will theoretically generate on Windows. However rebar.config is missing Windows compilation instructions. So nothing will happen.
  * Same with Linux.
* Install latest build of [Houdini 14](http://www.sidefx.com/index.php?option=com_download&Itemid=208) .
  * If you choose to install to a custom location, you may need to patch rebar.config .
* Install [Erlang](http://www.erlang.org/download.html) (build it yourself or install pre-built).
  * This NIF library relies on enif_schedule_nif, which requires a fairly recent Erlang OTP, for example OTP 17.5 .
  * If you choose to install to a custom location, you may need to patch rebar.config .
* Install [Rebar](https://github.com/rebar/rebar) (build it yourself or install through something like [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/)).
* Install [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org/) (build it yourself or install through [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) or install pre-packaged).

## Building.
Use Rebar:

```
rebar get-deps
rebar compile
```
To clean:
```
rebar clean
```
To run tests:
```
rebar eunit
```

## Running.  

Run erl:

```
> code:add_path("ebin").
true
```
